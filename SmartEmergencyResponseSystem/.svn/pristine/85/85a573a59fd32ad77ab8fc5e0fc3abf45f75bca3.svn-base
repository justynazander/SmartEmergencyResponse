%  Script to setup a heterogeneous fleet of autonmous vehicles.  The
%  fleet consists of  fixed wing aircraft, rotorcraft, and ground vehicles.
%  
%  Fixed wing uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAV): Physics and control
%  systems based on the University of Minnesota UAV models. Guidance
%  algorithms are developed to track waypoints and execute mission plans. 
%
%  Rotorcraft: A quadrotor type UAV is used in the simulation. The Parrot 
%  ARDrone vehicle is simulated based on models derived via blackbox system
%  identification. Outer loop controllers are designed to track waypoints
%  and execute missions. 
%
%  Ground Vehicles: A simple point mass model of a ground vehicle is used.
%  Guidance algorithms are developed to track the desired position of the
%  vehicles.
